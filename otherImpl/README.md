1. lib`n`.nim (n is 2,3,...) show different ways to invoke c-lib's function.  
  For details, see their module document as well as source codes
2. each libn.nim can either be a lib or a executable-module, which is implemented by `when` and `declared` (`defined` can also be helpful)

# note
Only code about opening "about:blank" is written,
while opening other url is easy to implement.
